# QuoteBot
QuoteBot is an intelligent, interactive chatbot that helps users discover meaningful quotes based on any input question or topic. Built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system first retrieves semantically relevant quotes from a large dataset and then generates a concise, contextual response using a language model.
